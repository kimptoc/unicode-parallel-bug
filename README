This project is just to demonstrate a bug I am seeing when using unicode in parallel - hopefully.

To run it:

gem install bundler
bundle install       # note the Gemfile assumes the use of the local proxy rubygems.dev.  If not, switch it with the line above it.

rake test_it

This loads a csv file of unicode'd words and tries to convert them to ascii - doing it in parallel.

Works fine when not run in parallel.

Gives this error:

uninitialized constant ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Chars
/Users/kimptoc/.rvm/gems/jruby-1.6.3@p-unicode-paralle-bug/gems/activesupport-3.0.9/lib/active_support/multibyte.rb:22:in `proxy_class'

/Users/kimptoc/Documents/ruby/ecom/unicode-parallel-bug/app/models/test_main.rb:13:in `go'

Not quite the expected error - but perhaps related.  Was hoping for this error:

ActiveSupport::Multibyte is not missing constant Unicode

NOTES:

1)  assumed use of RVM to manage ruby versions/gems
2)  branches 1.9.2 and 1.8.7 exist, testing the same with MRI  - they seem to work ok.
